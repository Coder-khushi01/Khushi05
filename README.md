On the first day. I have learned about linux

**LINUX is an open source os that is widely used in computers and other devices.It's also known for its stability,security and flexibility.**


 **Difference between window and linux?**
 LINUX                                   WINDOW  
It is a open source.                       It is a close source.
It is free of cost                         It  requires licensing fees.
It is more secure than window.             It's not more secure than linux
It is highly customized.                   It is limited customized options.
It is more helpful for programmer          On the other hand we can use the window for gaming.

** I install the Linux on window .**
