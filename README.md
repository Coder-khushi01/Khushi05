On the first day. I have learned about linux

**LINUX is an open source os that is widely used in computers and other devices.It's also known for its stability,security and flexibility.**


 **Difference between window and linux?**
 LINUX                                  
It is a open source.                      
It is free of cost                        
It is more secure than window.             
It is highly customi*zed.                   
It is more helpful for programmer          



**window**
It is close source.
It requires licensing fees.
It is not more secure than Linux
It is limited customized.
on the other we can use the window for gaming.

** I install the Linux on window .**
